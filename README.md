# gleiten
easily create html animations based on vertical scroll position of the page.

**NOTE**: if you just want some animation on elements when they are "scrolled into view", there are better libraries to achieve that such as [AoS](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/). this library helps you design animations based on general scroll position.

## how to use

```javascript
gleiten.init();
```
